# Introduction: 
MangoDB is a lightweight social media platform app that was developed by Kushal Mamillapalli (https://github.com/Techdude01), Sihan Ma (https://github.com/sihanma666), and Ayush Sarkar (https://github.com/asarkar17812). 

I personally owe a massive thank you to both Kushal and Sihan. Both of you are incredible groupmates and were nothing but friendly, prompt, and diligent for the length of the project. 

## Objectives: 
Through SQL, Flask, CSS, HTML, and some JavaScript, this project aims to create a Reddit-like app that enables a Q&A social platform with interaction features like commenting, liking and disliking, and sorting by certain 
metafeatures, like engagement and time-posted. We also implement standard security practices at the database and application levels, including normalization of table keys, role-based access control, session management, and more.
